# Custom Themes

You can create and use custome themes, they are loaded by a directive in .vscode.settings.json

Sort of ties us to vscode, but I think there is a command line option to load css styles, or themes as well. 

Also note, I think if we enable html then we can do pretty much inline html, we need to research the security risks they mention, but we might be fine.
